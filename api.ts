Conditions also known as Predicates are logical expressions that result in a boolean. Operators are used to describe rules between arguments to form that condition. There are 3 families of operators: Boolean, Math and String. Math and String operators are functions that transform arguments into numbers or strings...&lt;h1&gt;Boolean Operators&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 arg:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;IS_NULL&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;IS_NOT_NULL&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_IS_EMPTY&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;NOT &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MAP_IS_EMPTY&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;EQ&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;NE (Not Equals)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;GT (Greater Than)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;GOE (Greater Or Equals)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LT (Lesser Than)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LOE (Lesser Or Equals)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;OR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;AND&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;XNOR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;XOR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CONTAINS_KEY (for maps only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CONTAINS_VALUE (for maps only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MATCHES (regex)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MATCHES_IC (regex ignore case)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STARTS_WITH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STARTS_WITH_IC&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;EQ_IGNORE_CASE&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ENDS_WITH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ENDS_WITH_IC&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_CONTAINS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_CONTAINS_IC&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LIKE (SQL like)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 args exceptions:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;IN&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;NOT_INT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Math Operators&lt;/h1&gt;1 arg:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;NEGATE&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MAP_SIZE&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_LENGTH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CEIL&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ABS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;FLOOR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ROUND&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;RANDOM (no arg)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;RANDOM2 (seed arg)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;NUMCAST&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;HOUR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MINUTE&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SECOND&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MILLISECOND&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;YEAR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;WEEK&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;YEAR_MONTH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;YEAR_WEEK&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DAY_OF_WEEK&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DAY_OF_MONTH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DAY_OF_YEAR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;WEEK&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;WEEK&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;WEEK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ADD&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIV&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MULT&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SUB&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;POWER&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MOD&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LOCATE (index of (string, char))&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_YEARS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_MONTHS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_WEEKS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_DAYS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_HOURS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_MINUTES&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;DIFF_SECONDS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;MIN&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;MAX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;String Operators&lt;/h1&gt;0 arg:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;CURRENT_TIME&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 arg:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;CURRENT_TIME&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LOWER&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;UPPER&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;TRIM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_CAST&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;CHAR_AT&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SUBSTR_1ARG (substr(string, start))&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;CONCAT&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;TRIM&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;STRING_CAST&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 args:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;SUBSTR_2ARGS (substr(string, start, length))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
